# Unreviewed UniProtKB identifiers

Not all records in the UniProtKB are reviewed. The used identifier is of such a record.

## Why does this fail show up?

This test signals proteins annotated with UniProtKB identifiers of unreviewed protein sequence
records.

## Curation action

Check if [UniProtKB](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/) has more information about the gene, and
possibly links to a curated record.
