# Potentially imprecise UniProt identifier

This test signals that one or more proteins are annotation with the UniProtKB identfier `P62805`
which is encoded by 14 different genes.

## Why does this fail show up?

By linking to 14 different genes, it may result in links to transcriptomics data which is not accurate.

## Curation action

Check if there is a specific gene that encodes for the protein that is of importance to this pathway.
