# At least one reference

This test checks if the pathway cites external resources. Each pathway
should have at least one reference.

Currently, the GPML supports PubMed identifiers, DOIs, and ISBN numbers.

## Why does this fail show up?

The pathway does not cite a reference with a PubMed identifier, DOI, or ISBN.

## Curation action

An additional PubMed identifier or DOI can be added to the pathway.
