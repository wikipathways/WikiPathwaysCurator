# Water chemical formula can use Unicode

This test checks for labels of water data nodes which can use Unicode.

## Why does this test show up?

For a water data node the label H2O is used, but the chemically more correct Unicode
version H₂O can be used.

## Curation action

Open the pathway and replace the H2O label with a H₂O label.

IMPORTANT: PathVisio 3.3 currently does not display Unicode characters correctly in the
main view, but it can still be used to edit the labels. After uploading, the classic and
the new website will display the Unicode label correctly.
