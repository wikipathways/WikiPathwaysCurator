# Retired LIPID MAPS identifiers

This test checks if LIPID MAPS identifiers found in GPML pathways have
been retired. If they are, they should no longer be used and be replaced
with the replacing LIPID MAPS identifier.

## Why does this fail show up?

The identifier has been retired by LIPID MAPS, like, for example, [LMFA01010040](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd/LMFA01010040).

## Curation action

If the test fails, you can check [the LIPID MAPS website](https://lipidmaps.org/databases/lmsd) if a reason is given.
Second, you can look up a new valid LIPID MAPS identifier. The GPML source
of the pathway can then be updated to list the new identifier.
