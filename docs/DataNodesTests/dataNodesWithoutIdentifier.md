# Datanodes without identifier

This test checks if data nodes have an identifier.

## Why does this fail show up?

The DataNode does not have an identifier, which makes it impossible to link experimental data
to this data node.

## Curation action

Add the missing identifier. [This WikiPathways Academy](https://academy.wikipathways.org/stages/draw-geneproduct/)
page describes how.
