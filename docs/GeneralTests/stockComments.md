# The pathway contains stock comments

The pathway GPML contains one or more of the following comments:

```xml
<Comment>Type your comment here</Comment>
```

## Why does this fail show up?

The PathVisio user interface makes it easy to add a new comment element and it is not
always easy to detect. It shows up as comment on the website, however.

## Curation action

Finding the comment is not trivial to find in PathVisio. Experts may actually edit the
GPML in a XML-aware text editor instead.
