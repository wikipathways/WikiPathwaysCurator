# Common metabolite-metabolite conversion identifier

Common identifiers for `mim-conversion` interactions are `Rhea` and `Reactome`.

## Why does this fail show up?

The test checks for common identifiers for `mim-conversion` interactions and flags uncommon
identifiers.

## Curation action

If the identifier is acceptable, request that data source as acceptable in [this tracker](https://github.com/wikipathways/WikiPathwaysCurator/issues).

Otherwise, correct the identifier. Perhaps there is a spelling mistake in the data source?
