# Unexpected metabolic conversion

Interaction of type `mim-conversion` are chemical conversions that happen between two metabolite-type
entities.

## Why does this fail show up?

The `Interaction` was typed as `mim-conversion` but is not an interaction between two metabolites
or two RNA molecules.

## Curation action

Curation of this one is non-trivial for interactions that involve multiple `DataNode`s. Expert knowledge
may be needed.
